///udphp_serverPunch()

/*
**  Description:
**      This script will do two things:
**         * Connect with master server if counter is reached
**         * Connect with all clients that want to connect via hole punching
**      Requirement: Configured server (udphp_config and udphp_createServer)
**      This should be used in the step event of the server object.
**      Throws a warning to the debug log when server doesn't exist. Don't call this
**      function after you called stopServer.
**  
**  Usage:
**      udphp_serverPunch()
**
**  Arguments:
**      <none>
**
**  Returns:
**      <nothing>
**
