///mp_tolerance(groupname,tolerance)

/*
**  Description:
**      If a tolerance is set, a change in the variables sent via network will
**      only be applied locally if the change is greater than the tolerance.
**      This can be used to make the player not jump all over the place when
**      his position is just slightly out of sync, which make your game look
**      much smoother. 
**      This can be used if the buffer type set for this group is not buffer_bool
**      or buffer_string, otherwise errors will occur.
**      This can also be used with all preset mp_add* functions 
**      (e.g. mp_addPosition)
**  
**  Usage:
**      <See above>
**
**  Arguments:
**      groupname   string       the name of the previously added group
**      tolerance   real         the tolerance to apply
**
**  Returns:
**      <nothing>
**
