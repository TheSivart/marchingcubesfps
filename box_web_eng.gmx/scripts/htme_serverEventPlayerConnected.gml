/*
**  Description:
**      PRIVATE "METHOD" OF obj_htme! That means this script MUST be called with obj_htme!
**
**      This will register a new player, tell him his playerhash and send a PLAYER_CONNECTED
**      packet to all players
**  
**  Usage:
**      <See above>
**
**  Arguments:
**      ip       string      ip of the new player
**      port     real        port that the new player connected on
**
**  Returns:
**      <nothing>
